"As the great beast snores </br>
his belly can be seen rising </br>
right from the entrance of his hideout </br>
if you're close enough. </br>
Above, the trees breathe with him. </br>
The forest's heart and hands, </br>
though he sleeps </br>
he's on guard for any child who finds it </br>
in the long grass." </br>
